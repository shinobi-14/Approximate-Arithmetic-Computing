# Approximate Arithmetic Design using Dynamic and Runtime Techniques
Approximate computing is a way to save power and resources by allowing a trade-off in accuracy. Most existing designs use a fixed level of approximation, which makes them less flexible.

This project proposes **dynamic techniques** with a **runtime-configurable arithmetic unit** that can switch between exact and approximate modes depending on what the system needs or performance constraints. This makes the design more energy-efficient, faster, and still good enough in terms of output quality, which can be useful for many applications.


To demonstrate this, I have tried implementing the technique on a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) and a 16-bit RCA, with their simulation outputs/reports included in the repository.

This project is still under development, and I’m still trying to have better control over power, delay, and accuracy trade-offs 😅.
